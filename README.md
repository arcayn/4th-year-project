# 4th year project repo 

This code is not intended to be "software" as such, more a repo of scripts/notebooks used for numerical experiments over the course of the project. 

The `interface.py` file defines a `SpectralPipeline` class that can be used for simple (known-alternative distribution) prediction in conjunction with the `WSBM` class and `example.ipynb` demonstrates end-to-end graph generation and prediction with the class.
